The following is a detailed description file for the code, including the code's dependencies, installation instructions, functional module description, usage steps and precautions.

Dependency Environment
The code requires the following environment and dependencies:
- Python 3.8 or higher
- The following Python libraries must be installed:
- `opencv-python`
- `numpy`
- `librosa`
- `scikit-image`
- `moviepy`

Dependency Installation
Use the following command to install all dependencies through `pip`:

pip install opencv-python numpy librosa scikit-image moviepy

Functional Module Description
The code is divided into multiple functional modules to achieve specific processing tasks:

1. Video Merger The `merge_videos` function merges multiple video files into one video and adjusts the resolution, frame rate and audio sampling rate of all videos to be consistent.

2. Video Preprocessing: The `preprocess_video` function converts the merged video frames into grayscale images, removes noise and performs normalization.
3. Audio preprocessing: `preprocess_audio` function normalizes the audio part to ensure the stability of audio features.
4. Feature extraction:
- Image feature extraction: `extract_lbp` and `process_video` functions extract LBP (local binary pattern) features from video frames.
- Audio feature extraction: `extract_audio_features` function extracts MFCC features from audio.
5. Feature fusion: `combine_features` function fuses the extracted image and audio features to generate the final feature file.

Project directory structure
The code will store the output data in the following directories. Please make sure that these directories exist in the project folder or allow the code to automatically create them:
- `NeuCube/database/s1`: used to store the extracted image feature files.
- `NeuCube/database/v1`: used to store the extracted audio feature files.
- `NeuCube/database/c1`: used to store the fused image and audio feature files.

Usage steps

1. Prepare video files:
- Put the video files in the project root directory and set the path of the `video_files` list in the `main` function. Make sure the path and file name are correct.

2. Run the code:
- Open the terminal or command line tool and navigate to the directory where the code is located.
- Run main.py

- The code will perform the following operations in sequence:
1. Video merging: Merge multiple videos into a video with uniform resolution, frame rate, and audio sampling rate.
2. Video preprocessing: Grayscale, denoise, and normalize the merged video.
3. Feature extraction: Extract LBP (image) features and MFCC (audio) features from the video.
4. Feature fusion: Fusion the extracted image and audio features and save them as a CSV file.
3. Output files:
- Merge video files: The final merged video file is saved as `merged_video.mp4`.
- Image feature file: saved in the `NeuCube/database/s1` directory, stored in the `samX_aa.csv` format.
- Audio feature file: saved in the `NeuCube/database/v1` directory, stored in the `samX.csv` format.
- Fusion feature file: saved in the `NeuCube/database/c1` directory, stored in the `samX.csv` format.

After the code is executed, the terminal will display "Video merging, feature extraction and fusion completed. Video output is: merged_video.mp4".
